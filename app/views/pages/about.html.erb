<b>Purpose</b>
<p>
  To investigate how corals resist stress through development of a powerful sea
  anemone model system and related experiments with corals, sea anemones and
  the symbiotic algae that reside in them. The funding will be used to enhance
  researchers' abilities to predict coral resilience by identifying early,
  reliable signals that result from changing environmental conditions.

<p>
With support from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the National Science
Foundation, Dr. John Pringle and his team at Stanford have been working to
understand how corals resist stress. To develop hypotheses about coral stress,
Dr. Pringleâ€™s group is first studying sea anemones, which are evolutionary cousins
of corals. By developing a sea anemone experimental model system, his team is
attempting to identify early, reliable signals of stress that result from changing
environmental conditions. These results will then be tested with corals at a field
site in American Samoa to see how well the scientists can predict coral resilience
in a natural environment.

<p>
  Developing an understanding of factors that are causing degradation of the coral reefs
  and the interaction between the cnidarian (animal partner) and the alga (dinoflagellate
  called Symbiodinium; photosynthetic partner) in the formation of the endosymbiotic
  association required for coral survival. Elevated temperatures and changing pH of marine
  ecosystems are beginning to adversely affect the coral reefs. We are trying to establish,
  at the molecular level, how and why this is happening.

<p>
Now contains a data-repository page (http://palumbi.stanford.edu/data/
) that hosts the assemblies and annotation files for each of the coral species analyzed in the
field studies at Ofu Island, American Samoa. These data are described in the Ladner et al.
and Barshis et al. manuscripts  and are being simultaneously made
available to the National Park Service office responsible for the Ofu research center. In
addition, the full environmental dataset is being readied for deposit on this site as a set of
Excel and flat files.
